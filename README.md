# Error-from-logs
Simple java code to pull all the errors from log files
I made this because going through all the logs manually is a chore. 
This program most certainly won't work out of the box because of the regex is created specifically my project, however you are free to change it and use it. 

I used https://regex101.com/ to build my regex
